# Tenzents-Employee

This bot will perform arbitrage using aave's flashloan as a way to protect personal funds. 
- two wallets 
  - 1 for gas fees which will have funds inside already
  - 2 for profits made through arbitrage 
- starting very basic, tenzent's employee will only be looking for differences in prices of the magic token between uniswap and sushiswap decentralized exchanges.
- test deployment will happen in remixide (with goerli?)
- unit tests will be written in foundry
